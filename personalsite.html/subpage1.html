    <h1>Kingdom Hearts II</h1>
    <p>Kingdom Hearts II was released on the playstation 2 in 2005 in Japan the game takes place after the Events of Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, Cahin of memories was a game that was released on the gameboy and you use cards to fight and progress throught the game</p>
    <p>In Kingdom Hearts II you start out as Roxas in the world of Twilight Town there he learns that he is a nobody and that he is in a simulated version of twilight town becasue he has to wait for Namine to restore Sora's memories and heart. Why does this matter for Roxas wll that is becasue he is Sora's Nobody</p>
    <p>A nobody is what is left after someone loses their heart and becomes a heartless the body that is left becomes a nobody. We laern that Organizaton 13 is made up of 13 nobodies and they want to kill heartless and put the hearts into kingdom hearts then they will take the hearts form kingdom hearts to give themselves hearts</p>
    <p>Kingdom Hearts II is a confusing game story wise but the combat and fighting mechanics is what really puts this game above the rest</p>
    <p>once Roxas wakes up Sora after the 2 hour tutorial that is when the game goes off and you learn that Sora can now weild two keyblades and he goes to all the disney world to help fight the darkness and stop Organization 13 from meddling in the affairs of Disney Characters </p>
