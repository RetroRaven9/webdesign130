    <h1>Kingdom Hearts IV</h1>
    <p>We are still waiting for any updates for Kingdom Hearts IV</p>
    <p>While we wait lets talk about what we know *SPOLIERS* Sora is dead again and he is in Quadratum "Tokyo" all we know so far is that sora will fight the heartless darkside</p>
    <p>Well with what we know out of the way here are my top world choices for Kingdom Hearts IV</p>
    <h2>Number 10</h2>
    <h3>Wreck it Ralph</h3>
    <p>A movie about a videogame how better can that get. Rlph was a summon charcter in Kingdom Hearts 3. The arcade would be cool to explore and play around and they could even have a tron refrence to connect back to kingdom hearts 2.</p>
    <h2>Number 9</h2>
    <h3>Tresure Planet</h3>
    <p>I just think it would be cool but i also dont see it happening.</p>
    <h2>Number 8</h2>
    <h3>Brave</h3>
    <p>It would be cool to have Meridth and a companion to fight beside and then the end boss can be a heartless that is a bear</p>
    <h2>Number 7</h2>
    <h3>Jungle Book</h3>
    <p>Instead of the winnie the pooh they could do the jungle book and the players have to find the scaterd pages of the book</p>
    <h2>Number 6</h2>
    <h3>Coco</h3>
    <p>I think going to the land of the dead woud fit becasue sora is dead.</p>
    <h2>Number 5</h2>
    <h3>Encanto</h3>
    <p>The movie was popular but we dont talk about bruno</p>
    <h2>Number 4</h2>
    <h3>Princess and the Frog</h3>
    <p>I would love to fight the voodoo man and the voodoo heartess and being in a swamp and city of new orleans would be cool</p>
    <h2>Number 3</h2>
    <h3>Moana</h3>
    <p>I liked the Island and boat mechanic in the Pirates world in Kingdom Hearts 3 and they could just bring that over for a moana world and the boss fight being the singing crab would be great</p>
    <h2>Number 2</h2>
    <h3>Incredibles</h3>
    <p>Figting in a city with superheros would be cool and I feel like this would ft alot better than doing anything marvel and it would be simple to base it off the big hero 6 world from kingdom hearts 3</p>
    <h2>Number 1</h2>
    <h3>Star Wars</h3>
    <p>Star Wars would be a legendary choice for Kingdom Hearts IV and you could fly the gummie ship to take out the death star and a starwars keyblade would be legit. I think Star Wars also works becasue it is very good verses evil and finding the good like Riku bing on the darkside so it hink sora could help luke with helping vader to change to light side </p>
